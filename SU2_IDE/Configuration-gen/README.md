# Confugaration Builder for SU2

This is a single page Web application, where you can create a configuration for SU2 runs. Presently it is only testing in Firefox. This is build on top of [Angular Dynamic Forms](https://github.com/danhunsaker/angular-dynamic-forms). 

This is the initial version, from time to time there will be changes on this. Please get the latest version.

# Usage

Run the command 
```

copyhpp-cppfiles.bat
```

It will copy the hpp and cpp files. And if firefox is installed and will launch it and display the form.

It is that simple. On the right hand panel, the changes will be reflected. You can copy the content and save it as a .cfg file. And start using SU2_CFD.
