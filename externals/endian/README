This provides the endian conversion functions form endian.h on Windows, 
Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X. You still need to use -std=gnu99 instead 
of -std=c99 for gcc. The functions might actually be macros. 
Functions: htobe16, htole16, be16toh, le16toh, htobe32, htole32, 
be32toh, le32toh, htobe64, htole64, be64toh, le64toh.

The header file portable_endian.h is distributed with SU2 in
SU2/externals/endian/ in unmodified form, including license.
The license statement is repeated below.
